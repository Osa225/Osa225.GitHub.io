        <p> Welcome to my website! This website was created by me to show my Javascripts and also
            let you guys know a little about me. The website was created using Github and also the PIxlr 
            program to edit images for the website. There are three tabs at the top that are linked to 
            the home page of the website, the Javascripts, and the About Me pages. Below those tabs 
            is a picture of me. Right now my website does not have much but stay tune because there will
            be more contents coming!
